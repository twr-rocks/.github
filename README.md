A software product designed to enhance the consumption of Apache Kafka topics, providing guaranteed ordering at a key level, rather than just the partition. This allows consumers to retry in the case of failures, without either losing the order (e.g. by sending to a dead letter topic), or blocking other records in the partition with different keys. Whether or not to guarantee ordering can be set per record. It additionally support delayed delivery, backoff during retries, time-to-live per record This allows you to build scalable concurrent self-healing systems while still fulfilling ordering requirements.
